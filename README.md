This is an attempt to add more accurate names to the already excellent Ello's DPS mod. 

This was done by lots of tedious hunting down of ability names, and the addition of some lookup tables.

Changes from the original:
- Attack is consolidated into a single source
- Special is consolidated into a single source
- Cast, Dash-Strike, Dash-Upper are named as such
- Traps, Magma, and Environmental (falling rubble) each have their own categories now
- Enemy Deflect/Charm category is a potpourri of enemy abilities - in general if a source name looked suspiciously like enemy damage it's because it was caused by deflect or charm. Some stuff ends up in here incorrectly.

Known issues:
- Not all abilities are updated yet
- Dusa summon tracks as Enemy Deflect/Charm
- Dragon Rush is displayed as Bull Rush
- Some other stuff incorrectly shows up as Enemy Deflect/Charm
